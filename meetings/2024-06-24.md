## Special Topic - Shapes

 - Michal has a [proposal for a shape manager software](https://github.com/ldsham/proposal/blob/main/README.md) and is interested in improving the developer experience
 - Ludwig interested in simplifying shape schema languages, migrating and versioning shapes, no-code shape UI
 - Ted cochaired the end of the Shapes WG (that produced SHACL 1.0 REC), will be in the anticipated SHACL 2.0 or 1.2 (specific version TBD) WG, also contributes occasional bits contributed to ShEx
 - Jeff working on shape design for services and products in the Solid ecosystem
 - Jesse [applied for grant funding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BphUfkEgQmRc0M00QDmVXVInaMdYiZOzXO0Aet6mOL4/edit?usp=sharing) to build a shape repository in the style of DefinitelyTyped, next to his PhD
 - Jesse also plans on pushing a compact syntax for ShaCL in the working group
 - Elf is using shapetrees to instruct agents when querying resources
 - Jeff might setup a github repository for collecting efforts/resources about using shapes in the solid ecosystem

## Questions discussed
- Should a shape repository curate "high-quality" shapes or should it be community curated?
    - curation by w3c/community groups could ease the use of shapes
    - a community curated platform would have other advantages
    - government projects need to strictly use government provided shapes
    - it might be problematic if there are duplicate shapes
- Could we establish a non-technical source for listing/organising resources for learning about shapes/the efforts around establishing shapes?
    - create a github repo with a collection awesome resources
    - create a forum thread
- How do we align between different shapes:
    - Jesse: We can use classic schema mappings here. We have expressive reasoners like EYE working in the browser now (https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye-js, https://github.com/comunica/comunica-feature-reasoning/, https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js/pull/296) so such tooling can be used to apply publicly available mappings between shapes declared as [N3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/).
    - Ludwig: Are more complex mappings needed for some translations/reasoning?
    - Ludwig: Do we need a application-level schema to abstract the use of RDF on a database-level?
    - Jesse: There is similar tooling to what Ludwig is describing
