### New Member Check-in (brief intro, current work)
(suggestion: post-holiday-break check-in: A quick round for all, 1 minute per person, what folks been up to)

* Philippe: Involved in Solid for a coule of years, independent
* Theo: Looking forward to continue with FedCM, maybe some other authn. How we can connect Solid with other stuff that already exists.
* Ludwig: Still working on thesis. Looking into code generation.
* TimBL: Coding on SolidOS. Solid Profile, the public piece should be interesting. We have LinkedIn, people could have their Solid Profile. I want to add allergies. 
* Grace: I'm helping Tim, you can 
* Pavlik: https://www.w3.org/2024/09/TPAC/group-updates.html#solid
* Helen: I'm working with espresso project, doing search taking into account access policies. Using Solid as a starting point. 
* Michal: I've been working on Solid based hospitality exchange. How Solid could be more social. Now working under new name [SolidCouch](https://solidcouch.org) ([github](https://github.com/solidcouch)). Focusing on a map, created an index which can offer optimisation. I also wrote a small middleware which allows services to authenticate, hope to publish it soon.
* Jeff: I worked on developing a catalog https://github.com/solid-contrib/catalog

### Philippe

* Used to work with data village
* I implemented a pod browser
* As a customer, you can reclaim user data from major companies. For example from big retailers. I wrote a few importers where one can fill pod with one's purchase history. One can cross that data with open food facts etc. 
* https://test.solidbench.dev/
* I tried to use existing data model, didn't find prior work so I use schema.org
* Another use case is related to annotations, similar to what Sarven does with dokieli
* The idea is to annotate anything, I can annotate HTML and PDF. Later people can collaborate on editing it.
* Depending on the retailer, one can get a barcode. With that something like open food facts can be use to enrich the data. https://world.openfoodfacts.org/
* At this moment I support two belgian retailers and Amazon.
* I have ecosore and nutriscore to help me change my habits.
* I still need to clean up the code before publishing it. I will do it!

### Theo

* https://w3c-fedid.github.io/FedCM/
* https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/blob/main/2024/2024-09-23-TPAC.md
* FedCM state: implementing https://github.com/w3c-fedid/multi-idp/issues/2 would be a huge improvment for Solid UX. But to implement it the team behing the FedCM standard would like to see market demands from Relying parties. 

### Helen

* ESPRESSO Latest Publications:  https://espressoproject.org/publications/
* ESPRESSO Use Cases:  https://github.com/espressogroup/ESPRESSO/blob/main/ESPRESSO%20Use%20Cases.pdf
* We started indexing at pod level, now I'm working on the server level aggregation. It still would check the access. We want to use it to route queries more efficiently.
* We work with healthcare records, which would be held on patient owned pods.
* Someone doing diabetis research could search for specific keywords if patient granted access for that research institiution.
* eP: Linked Web Storage WG is now active https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/lws/

### Michal

* 200 people have signed up till now
* I have code allowing bot to authenticate
* Till now I had to use CSS and give bot it's own credentials, now bot has its own IdP
* I implemented a library to follow nose through data. Starting from url and following the knowledge graph.
    * monorepo: https://github.com/ldhop/ldhop
    * npm libraries: https://www.npmjs.com/org/ldhop
    * overview: https://github.com/ldhop/ldhop/blob/main/packages/core/README.md

### Ludwig

* I work on a photobook app. I am trying to develop data standards around social networks and software to reproduce them.
