## Agenda

* Demo of Jeff's Solid Cataloger
    * The software shows resources in the Solid Project (Services,Software,Forums,Chats,etc.) using a dynamic search of an RDF data source.  The goals include : 
        * generating solidproject.org website from RDF using Solid tools
        * showcasing the people, organizations, and project of the Solid Practioners
        * creating general shapes for describing oranizations and their resources that would allow cataloging across organizations
        * eventually create forms so that data can be edited by end users
        * eventually create a distributed process where any resource that has an RDF description of itself can submit it rather than needing the description to be stored in a cental catalog.  [Wilf added the suggestion that there could be a search of all catalogs I have access to and generate the catalog from that]

* Future Meetings
    * Jeff asked if we should go on hiatus for the summer and/or change times.  Several people indicated a desire to keep meeting so we will continue.  Time change to be discussed at a future meeting.
